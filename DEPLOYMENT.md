# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Files Created for Deployment:
1. `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration file
2. `public/_redirects` - SPA routing configuration  
3. Updated `package.json` - Removed TypeScript checking from build

## Manual Deployment Steps:

1. **Build the project locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
   - Drag and drop the entire `dist` folder
   - Or zip the `dist` folder contents and upload

## Automatic Deployment (Alternative):
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
3. Set build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

## Configuration Details:
- **Build Output**: `dist/` folder
- **SPA Routing**: Configured with `_redirects` file
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (TypeScript checking disabled for faster builds)

## Working Features:
✅ Event Board - Campus events for August 2025
✅ Societies & Clubs - 38 NSUT societies with Instagram links
✅ Medical Services - Healthcare directory
